FanVoice is a way for Super Fans to collaborate on writing tweets for their favorite fictional characters.

On FanVoice, there are:

Fictional characters: These are single objects tied to ONE twitter handle. A fictional character has many tweets.

Source: The source is the book, movie, game etc. that a character comes from. Only admins or users with access can create a source.

Scheduling: The core of the application is the ability to schedule tweets and write drafts.
